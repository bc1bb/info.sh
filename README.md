# `info.sh`
([info.sh](info.sh) is the 2018 script, [info_rewrite.sh](info_rewrite.sh) is the rewrote and updated script.)<br>
A little script that works like `screenfetch` or `neofetch` it shows infos about your device.

Neofetch, DoomQuakeKeen, Dryusdan, Outout, OrÃ¤kle, Leeo97one, and the whole community from Gnous (French Linux Discord).

## Install

### Package you need
- `curl` (or `wget`),
- `awk` (package name is sometimes `gawk`), `cut`, `head` and `grep`,
- `bash` (most shells should be supported).

### Fast execution
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jusdepatate/info.sh/master/info_rewrite.sh | bash`

### Download
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jusdepatate/info.sh/master/info_rewrite.sh
chmod +x info_rewrite.sh
./info_rewrite.sh
```

### If you get a `grep` warning
As I'm too lazy to work, just add `2>/dev/null` at the end of you command (for example `info.sh 2>/dev/null`)
